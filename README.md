## Description
This is a simple website to calculate users life expectancy on a different planet using the technologies I learned during my fifth week at Epicodus.

## Project Specefications

|  Behavior                 |  Input  | Output
|---------------------------|---------|-------
| **Spec 1: check if user input is number**| "20"| 20
| **Spec 2: calculate users average life expectancy in Earth.sets == 80**(later: UI logic?)| 80 | 80
| **Spec 3: Returns their age in Mercury years. (A Mercury year is .24 Earth years.)** | 20 | 83
| **Spec 4: Returns their age in Venus years. (A Venus year is .62 Earth years.)** | 20 | 32
| **Spec 5: Returns their age in Mars years. (A Mars year is 1.88 Earth years.)** | 20 | 11
| **Spec 6: Returns their age in Jupiter years. (A Jupiter year is 11.86 Earth years.)**| 20 | 43
| **Spec 7: Determines how many years a user has left to live on each planet.**    |
| **Spec 8: // UI logic // add user input boxes for current age and life expectancy and add click button for the answers for each planet**|
|  |
| **Spec 9: Each button leads to the output boxes and will show the message corresponding to the age of user input.**    |
